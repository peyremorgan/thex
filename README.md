_A gravity-enabled bubble shooter on an hexagon_

_thex_ plays like Tetris, but works like Bubble Shooter : you start with a grid full of random colored blocks, and try and empty it before the time runs out.

This is a work in progress (see [**What's left to do**](#What's_left_to_do)): we're currently in very early alpha.
